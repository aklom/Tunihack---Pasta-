Nowadays, it looks like for the Tunisian society, strikes have become a trend, or better say it’s the number one decision to solve problems. And sadly one of the main reasons of these strikes are demand of wages increase.
Considering the economical conditions of our country, wages’increases can be problematic and actually we may ask the following question: are we putting that extra money in the right place? can it be invested otherwise? 

On another hand, most Tunisian citizens are not aware of some important parameters related to the government budget although documents providing such information are totally accessible!

This is why we tried to figure out a way to help any tunisian citizen see the “big picture”, in order to think wisely and hopefully make a wise decision.

Before Starting to implement our project, we spent a considerable amount of time selecting the pieces of information that would help us put our idea/goal into the light.

We studied the pdf files of the annual budgetary reports of the ministries. We picked the parameters which reflect the amount of money spent on wages, compared to the total budget.

We also considered the evolution of that proportion from the year 2013 to 2017.

And also, in order to make the citizen see how some raise given to every employe in public sector can be impactful, we chose to give examples of how such amount can be good investments.
